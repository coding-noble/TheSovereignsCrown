# Overview

As a software engineer, I aimed to expand my knowledge by creating a Medieval-themed choose-your-own-adventure game. The software allows users to define their character's background, influencing the gameplay and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs). The primary focus was on developing a character creation menu within Visual Studio's Windows Form Applications, enabling users to select their class and background, consequently altering the game's narrative.

The software is a Medieval-themed choose-your-own-adventure game. It features a character creation menu that allows users to choose their character's class and background. These choices affect the storyline and interactions within the game, providing a unique experience for each player based on their selections.

The purpose of developing this software was to gain practical experience in coding complex programs using Visual Studio's Windows Form Applications. Through this project, I aimed to understand and implement the mechanics behind creating a dynamic character creation system that significantly impacts the game's progression and storyline.
